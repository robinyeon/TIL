- MVC
- SPA
- Two-way data biding
  - Two-way data binding refers to sharing data between a component class and its template. If you change data in one place, it will automatically reflate at the other end. For example, if you change the value of the input box, then it will also update the value of the attached property in a component class.

  - ***[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42217579/data-binding-in-react)***
    > Data binding in React can be achieved by using a controlled input. A controlled input is achieved by binding the value to a state variable and a onChange event to change the state as the input value changes.

    > With introduction of React hooks the state management (including forms state) became very simple and, in my opinion, way more understandable and predictable comparing with magic of other frameworks. For example:
    > ```
    > const MyComponent = () => {
    >    const [value, setValue] = React.useState('some initial value');
    >    return <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
    > }
    > ```
- TypeScript
